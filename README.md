# NCUA5300CallReport_ETL

Data from NCUA Zip Files will be imported to a relational model for storage and further analysis.
 
 
Requirements

    Anaconda - We will be using Jupyter Notebooks and the code will be written in Python.
    SQL Database - We will be using mySQL for this particular ETL, but the code can be updated for use in Oracle, SQL Server.

Objective: To extract all of the data that is provided to the general public by the NCUA governing body. The NCUA 5300 Call Report contains the public information that all credit unions must report to the NCUA governing body. This data will be used to create relational database tables to be stored in mySQL database for further analysis.


Procedure:

    Navigate to the NCUA website containing the zip files. Website can be found here: https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/credit-union-corporate-call-report-data/quarterly-data

    Download the desired zip file that you will be extracting. Begin with the most updated quarterly report because it contains the most number of columns to avoid adding them later.

    Open the Jupyter notebook containing the master code.
